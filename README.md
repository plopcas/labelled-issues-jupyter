# Labelled issues

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that will allow you to count issues that have been applied a specific label week on week, for a number of weeks that you choose.

This is particularly useful if you use a specific label to triage issues e.g. "triaged". You can then see how many issues were triaged week on week and by whom.
