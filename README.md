# Labelled issues

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and Python Script that will allow you to:

1. Count issues that have been applied a specific label week on week, for a number of weeks that you choose.
2. List out some data about each labelled issue, like Title, URL and person that labelled the issue.

This is particularly useful if you use a specific label to triage issues e.g. "triaged". You can then see how many issues were triaged week on week and by whom.
